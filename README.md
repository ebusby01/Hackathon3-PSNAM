Hello! 

This is what we did for the hackathon on Friday. We were having a bit of a challenging time with getting the containers to run.

At the start of the day on Friday, we were trying to get comfortable with Docker again. We were also trying to mess around with Jenkins until we figured out that that process would happen at the end when we were done with our containers. 

After lunch, I (Emily) started working in the Docker playground because I didn't want to mess anything up with our server. I was able to get a moodle container (without a database container) up and running; however, when I tried to replicate the steps again, I was running into issues. With the help of Augie and my team, I was able to fix my diskspace issues, and get a container up and running again. 

Our team wasn't able to fully finish the containers, but we worked hard the whole day trying to.
